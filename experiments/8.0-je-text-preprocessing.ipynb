    "To make things a little easier, and so that we don't run into any issues with the Twitter API (i.e. we don't make too many necessary calls to it), we'll be using data that's already been acquired. This data has tweets ranging from March 20, 2020 at ~1:30am through March 24, 2020 at 11:59pm. In this case, historical data gives us a good representation of what the streaming data will look like, and to experiment with various text pre-processing strategies without worrying about mistakenly eliminating too much information. \n",
