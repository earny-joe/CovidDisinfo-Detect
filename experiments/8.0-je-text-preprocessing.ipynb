This data has tweets ranging from March 20, 2020 at ~1:30am through March 24, 2020 at 11:59pm. In this case, historical data gives us a good representation of what the streaming data will look like, and to experiment with various text pre-processing strategies without worrying about mistakenly eliminating too much information. \n",
